# SpectrumAnalyzer---Course-project-for-OA

This was my final project for the course - University of Oulu, ohjelmoinnin alkeet. In essence this app can analyse data gathered from electron spectroscopy. 
I provided the simulated sample data in the repo and the guide under the 'help' button will help you with the usage.
Some libraries used in this code:
  - OS for file directories
  - numpy for math 
  - Ikkunasto for the graphical ui
    - Matplolib imported trough ikkunasto for plotting the graph
  Ikkunasto was provided for us in the course assignment, and I had earlier experience with matplotlib.
  
Overall, this was definitely a fun and constructive project.
